# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## My Crowdfunding Platform

### Overview

A web-based crowdfunding platform that allows users to create and fund creative projects. This PRD outlines the requirements for a Node.js/TypeScript backend API that supports user management, project creation, and basic funding operations.

### Target Audience

- Project creators seeking funding for creative endeavors
- Backers interested in supporting innovative projects
- Platform administrators managing the system

### Core Features

#### 1. User Management
**Requirements:**
- User registration with email verification
- Secure login/logout functionality
- Password hashing and secure storage
- User profile management
- Session management with configurable timeouts

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can register with unique username and email
- Passwords are hashed using industry-standard algorithms
- Users receive confirmation upon successful registration
- Login attempts are rate-limited to prevent brute force attacks

#### 2. Project Management
**Requirements:**
- Authenticated users can create projects
- Projects include title, description, funding goal, and deadline
- Project creators can update project details
- Public project listing with search and filtering
- Project status tracking (active, funded, expired)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Projects require authentication to create
- All required fields must be validated
- Projects display current funding progress
- Deadlines are enforced automatically

#### 3. Funding System
**Requirements:**
- Users can pledge funds to projects
- Secure payment processing integration
- Funding tracking and progress updates
- Refund capabilities for failed projects
- Transaction history for users

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Pledges are recorded securely
- Users can only pledge if authenticated
- Funding progress updates in real-time
- Clear transaction records maintained

#### 4. Security & Privacy
**Requirements:**
- HTTPS encryption for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
- Secure session management
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All user inputs are validated
- No sensitive data exposed in logs
- Sessions expire appropriately
- Failed login attempts are tracked

#### 5. API Design
**Requirements:**
- RESTful API design
- JSON response format
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Comprehensive error messages
- API versioning support
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All endpoints return consistent JSON responses
- Error responses include helpful messages
- API documentation is auto-generated and up-to-date

### Technical Requirements

#### Backend Architecture
- Node.js runtime with TypeScript
- Express.js web framework
- SQLite database with Drizzle ORM
- Passport.js for authentication
- Comprehensive logging system

#### Database Requirements
- User table with secure credential storage
- Project table with funding tracking
- Transaction/pledge history
- Session management
- Proper indexing for performance

#### Performance Requirements
- Response times under 500ms for API calls
- Support for 1000+ concurrent users
- Efficient database queries
- Caching for frequently accessed data

#### Scalability Requirements
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Database migration support
- Environment-based configuration
- Containerization support (Docker)

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Security
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Regular security audits
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure dependency management

#### Reliability
- 99.9% uptime target
- Graceful error handling
- Database backup and recovery
- Monitoring and alerting system

#### Usability
- Intuitive API design
- Clear error messages
- Comprehensive documentation
- Developer-friendly SDKs

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Foundation
- Basic user registration and authentication
- Project creation and listing
- Database schema implementation
- Basic API endpoints

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Payment integration
- Advanced project management
- User dashboard
- Search and filtering

#### Phase 3: Production Readiness
- Security hardening
- Performance optimization
- Monitoring and logging
- Comprehensive testing

### Success Metrics

- User registration conversion rate > 80%
- API response time < 300ms average
- Platform uptime > 99.5%
- Zero security incidents in production
- Positive user feedback on API usability

### Risks and Mitigations
